# Water Tank Problem – Web Visualization

## Description
This web application calculates the amount of water trapped between blocks
using the optimal two-pointer technique and visualizes the blocks using SVG.

## How to Run
1. Open index.html in a browser
2. Enter block heights as comma-separated values
3. Click "Calculate"

## Algorithm
- Two-pointer approach
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Example
Input: [0,4,0,0,0,6,0,6,4,0]
Output: 18 Units
